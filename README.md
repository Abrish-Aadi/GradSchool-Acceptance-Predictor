# Grad School Admit Predictor - Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a regression analysis to predict admission chances for graduate school applicants. The notebook explores the dataset available on Kaggle, which provides information about various factors that may influence a student's admission into graduate programs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed on Kaggle using the following link: [Graduates Admission Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshmanral/graduates-admission-prediction). It includes data on factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rankings, and other variables that can potentially impact admission outcomes.

## Notebook

The notebook file in this repository, named `Grad_School_Admit_Predictor_Reggressor.ipynb`, contains the code and documentation for the regression analysis performed on the graduate admission dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Contents

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preparation: This section focuses on loading the dataset, examining its structure, handling missing values, and performing any necessary data preprocessing steps.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Here, the dataset is explored through visualizations and statistical summaries to gain insights into the relationships between variables and the target variable (admission chance).

3. Model Building: In this section, machine learning regression models are trained on the dataset to predict admission chances. Various regression algorithms may be explored, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared to assess their performance and compare their predictive capabilities.

5. Conclusion: The concluding remarks provide a summary of the analysis, highlighting the key findings and insights gained from the regression analysis.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Clone this repository and open the `Grad_School_Admit_Predictor_Reggressor.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to execute the code cells and interact with the analysis.
